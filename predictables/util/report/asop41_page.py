#                       and belief
#         - Section 4.3 - Responsibility for Assumptions and Methods
#             - 4.3.1 - The actuary should assume responsibility for the assumptions and
#                       methods used in the actuarial report unless the actuary discloses:
#                 - 4.3.1a - The assumption or method that was set by another party
#                 - 4.3.1b - The party that set the assumption or method
#                 - 4.3.1c - The reason this party set the assumption or method

#                     - 4.3.1d(i) - The method conflicts with the actuary's professional
#                                     judgment about what is appropriate for the actuarial
#                                     assignment
#                     - 4.3.1d(ii) - The actuary was unable to form a professional judgment
#                                     about the appropriateness of the method without performing
#                                     a substantial amount of additional work that was outside
#                                     the scope of the actuarial assignment, and the actuary
#                                     did not do so, and so the actuary is not assuming
#                                     responsibility for the method
